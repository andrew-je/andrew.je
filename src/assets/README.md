# Assets Directory

## Profile Image Setup

To use your actual photo as the profile picture:

1. **Save your restaurant photo** as `profile.jpg` in this directory (`/src/assets/`)
2. **Crop the image** to a square aspect ratio (the photo of you in the restaurant will work great)
3. **Recommended size**: 400x400px or higher for best quality
4. **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP

The image will automatically:
- Display in a circular frame
- Scale to fit the profile avatar area
- Have hover effects and styling applied

Once you save the file, your actual photo will replace the placeholder and display perfectly in the circular profile area!
